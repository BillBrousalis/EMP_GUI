making sense of it all:
  * getting rid of 3d graphics (big cause of crashes)
  * after its done look to POSSIBLY bring it back

  * make serial_comms module NO-NONSENSE
  * make additional modules to handle file stuff (if needed)

  * create dictionaries to organize shit in gui
  
  * make it RESIZABLE

  * 4 tabs (5 with the ABOUT tab)

  tab Tuning:
    simple enough, no need for constant updating (look at thanasis gui for reference)
    add tuning with mouse wheel

  tab Monitor:
    run thread for the constant updating of values
    fix huge space reserved for values -> ugly
    make it prettier
    layout needs to make more sense
    add img to record button (OR use "*" symbol)
    "speed" slider is ugly, make it larger (?)

  tab graph:
    same updating needed as the monitor tab, probably works fine

  tab real-time-3d:
    getting rid of this

  tab advanced:
    make commands work
    make it pretty

  tab About:
    make it pretty


  generic shit:
    upon connecting to serial port successfully,
    receive dump of current values and place them in the tuning tab


    can crate error codes list to return back to the main gui if serial comm shit goes wrong
    access error code dict to determine error and throw error message accordingly



  thread management:
    create thread upon entering tab monitor or graph
    thread : while tab == monitor do ...
            


function to run after connecting to serial port:
  if tab == tuning:
    get_dump()
  else if tab == monitor || tab == graph:
    send command for monitor mode



tuning tab problems:
  have a way to iterate through the tuning values dict by entry id

make error system cleaner - jesus this is cluttered
